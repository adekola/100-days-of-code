### Day 18: January 24, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about techniques for optimizing HTML and CSS within projects in order to make for better performance. Also integrated Twitter TL into the personal web page (albeit it doesn't display at the moment. Perhaps because it's in localhost).

**Thoughts** Good to be onto some advanced CSS matters now.

### Day 14: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to add media to pages as well as fallback strategies to support older browsers. Made progress with the search feature on woki.

**Thoughts** I'm having a sort of headblock with respect to how to implement the search. I think it makes sense to first figure out how to seed the existing schema with data and from there, work out the practical approach to querying same.
