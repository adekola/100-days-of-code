# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I set up the first project I'll be working on in the course of the next 100 days of the challenge.

**Thoughts** It was interesting to get my feet into the Semantic-UI framework which I'll be using for the first time

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I got a hang of the Semantic UI framework and wired up the index page.
