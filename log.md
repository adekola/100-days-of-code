# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: January 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt how to add media to pages as well as fallback strategies to support older browsers. Made progress with the search feature on woki.

**Thoughts** I'm having a sort of headblock with respect to how to implement the search. I think it makes sense to first figure out how to seed the existing schema with data and from there, work out the practical approach to querying same.

### Day 13: January 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt list styling in CSS (outside vs inside). Made progress with the new design.

### Day 3: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Did the markup for the search feature.

**Thoughts** Almost missed coding today again after I missed yesterday. But I'm glad i did not. Semantic-UI framework's ain't as comprehensive but gradudaly getting familiar with it.
