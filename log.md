# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I set up the first project I'll be working on in the course of the next 100 days of the challenge.

**Thoughts** It was interesting to get my feet into the Semantic-UI framework which I'll be using for the first time

### Day 2: January 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I got a hang of the Semantic UI framework and wired up the index page.

**Thoughts** Getting to use the Semantic-UI framework wasn't as straighforward as Bootstrap. The docs could be better tho

### Day 3: January 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Did the markup for the search feature.

**Thoughts** Almost missed coding today again after I missed yesterday. But I'm glad i did not. Semantic-UI framework's ain't as comprehensive but gradudaly getting familiar with it. I also started brushing up my CSS/HTML5 skills on http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/. I think the landing page looks pretty neat and minimalistic.
